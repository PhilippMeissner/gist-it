# Gist It

Quickly and easily post the contents of the current editor to GitHub Gists. Just
type ⌥⌘G, type in a description and hit return, the Gist will be uploaded and
its URL will be copied to your system clipboard.

## Using Your GitHub Account

Gist It will post gists anonymously by default, to post to your own GitHub
account [generate a new token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the
`gists` scope and copy it into the package's preferences.
